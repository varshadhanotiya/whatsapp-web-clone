This project is a simple WhatsApp clone built with React and IndexedDB. The app allows users to chat with contacts, store messages offline using IndexedDB, and retrieve them even when the app is offline. It also provides basic functionalities like sending messages, selecting contacts, and displaying chat messages.

## Features

## Features

**Sending and Receiving Messages**
Users can send messages in the chat window. When a user sends a message, it's stored in IndexedDB, and the UI is updated immediately.

**Contact List**
The app allows users to view contacts and select one for chatting. The messages for the selected contact are fetched from IndexedDB.

**Mobile and Web Support**
Mobile View: The app is mobile-friendly, with a responsive design for both small and large screens.

Web View: The web version remains unchanged, offering full functionality for desktop and large screen devices.

## Development Notes
The app uses IndexedDB to store messages locally, allowing users to send messages while offline and synchronize them when online.
For simplicity, no backend is used for storing messages; instead, the app relies on IndexedDB for local storage.
